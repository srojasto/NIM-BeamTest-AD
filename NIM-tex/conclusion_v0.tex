\section{Conclusions.}

The performance of the detector is suitable for the purpose of its design: to have a good and homogeneous response 
along the plastic scintillator pad, is sensible to a minimum ionizing particle with good time resolutions. 
Additionally we prove that the time walk correction technique works also for 1 MIP and that the time resolution improves at higher charges.
Was identified the time of travel of the photons when particles hit in the PMT photocathode, the bunch of fibers 
placed near to the PMT and the plastic scintillator. 
The consistency of the ratios between the theoretical calculation of the energy deposited and the charge measured, have allow us to obtain an energy calibration of the FEE.
