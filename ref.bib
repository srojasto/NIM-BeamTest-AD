The single and double diffractive cross-sections are presented at 900 GeV 2.76 TeV and 7 TeV using an analysis method based on the classification of diffractive gaps. Promising early results on central diffractive processes have motivated the use of additional diffractive counters, which are currently being installed.}

  abstract  = {The selection of diffractive events in the ALICE experiment during the first data taking period (RUN-I) of the Large
  Hadron Collider (LHC) was limited by the range over which rapidity gaps occur. It would be possible to achieve better measurements by
  expanding the range in which the production of particles can be detected. For this purpose, the ALICE Diffractive (AD0) detector has
  been installed and commissioned for the second phase (RUN-II). Any new detector should be able to take the data synchronously with all
  other detectors and be operated through the ALICE central systems. One of the key elements that must be developed for the AD0 detector is
  the Detector Control System (DCS). The DCS must be designed to operate safely and correctly this detector. Furthermore, the DCS must also
  provide optimum operating conditions for the acquisition and storage of physics data and ensure these are of the highest quality. The
  operation of AD0 implies the configuration of about 200 parameters, from electronics settings and power supply levels to the archiving of
  operating conditions data and the generation of safety alerts. It also includes the automation of procedures to get the AD0 detector ready
  for taking data in the appropriate conditions for the different run types in ALICE. The performance of AD0 detector depends on a certain
  number of parameters such as the nominal voltages for each photomultiplier tube (PMT), their threshold levels to accept or reject the
  incoming pulses, the definition of triggers, etc. All these parameters define the efficiency of AD0 and they have to be monitored and
  controlled through AD0 DCS. Finally, AD0 DCS provides the operator with multiple interfaces to execute these tasks. They are realized as
  operating panels and scripts running in the background. These features are implemented on a SCADA software platform as a distributed control
  system which integrates to the global control system of the ALICE experiment.},

This detector will allow the study of processes with gaps at larger rapidity than those presently covered. A setup of two stations called AD (stands for ALICE Diffractive) on the right and on the left of the interaction point enhances significantly the efficiency to study diffractive physics and photon induced processes.}
